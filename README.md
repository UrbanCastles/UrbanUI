## Getting Started:

1. Clone the Urban UI repository.
2. Integrate the library into your WPF project.
3. Explore the enhanced controls and start creating a modern user interface.

## Usage:

### Modify `App.xaml`:

Open your `App.xaml` file and make the following modifications:

1. Add the Urban UI namespace at the top of the file:

    ```xml
    xmlns:urbanui="clr-namespace:UrbanUI.WPF.Controls;assembly=UrbanUI.WPF"
    ```

2. Include the Urban UI `ControlsDictionary` in the `MergedDictionaries` section:

    ```xml
    <ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
        <urbanui:ControlsDictionary/>
    </ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
    ```

These changes integrate Urban UI controls into your WPF application, providing a seamless modern look.

### Modify `MainWindow.xaml`:

Open your `MainWindow.xaml` file and make the following modifications:

1. Add the Urban UI namespace at the top of the file:

    ```xml
    xmlns:urbanUI="clr-namespace:UrbanUI.WPF.Controls;assembly=UrbanUI.WPF"
    ```

2. Replace your existing `Window` declaration with the Urban UI `Window`:

    ```xml
    <urbanUI:Window x:Class="MultiTool.MainWindow"
                 xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
                 xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
                 xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
                 xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
                 xmlns:urbanUI="clr-namespace:UrbanUI.WPF.Controls;assembly=UrbanUI.WPF"
                 Width="800"
                 Height="600"
                 MinWidth="650"
                 MinHeight="600"
                 Title="Multi-Tool"
                 mc:Ignorable="d" ResizeMode="CanResize">
    </urbanUI:Window>
    ```

These changes allow you to use the Urban UI `Window` in your MainWindow, providing a modernized and customizable window layout.
